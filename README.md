## Getting Started - Development
Ensure Godot 3.0 is installed and ready. Then, clone the following repos:
```
git clone https://github.com/dim35/CEN3031-Project-Server/
git clone https://github.com/dim35/CEN3031-Project/
```
### Server
Run the server by opening up the server project within Godot and running it.

### Client
When launching the client project, due to API calls validiating usernames and passwords with a Flask backend, validation may need to be disabled. To do so, set `check = false` within `CEN3031-Project/screens/login_screen/login_screen.gd`.

If the server was run locally, set the IP address to `127.0.0.1`. If the server was run on a different machine, enter the corresponding address. Be aware of the notice above.

## Game Controls
```
Movement: WASD and Arrow Keys
Sprinting: Shift + Left/Right/A/D
Attacking: hold X
```
